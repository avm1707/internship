    <p>
      Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, popularly known as Mahatma Gandhi, was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India. 
      He was a leader of India's non-violent independence movement against British rule and is internationally esteemed for his philosophy of nonviolence . 
      Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women’s rights, building religious and ethnic harmony, and achieving Swaraj—or self-rule. 
      He inspired civil rights movements across the world. Gandhi was assassinated on January 30, 1948, but remains a symbol of peace and nonviolent resistance.
